    <h2>Dear Ktaie, </h2>
    
    <p> 
    We survived rooming together! Yipee! I don't know what it is about the stigma of rooming with a friend or even someone you know from high school, but I'm glad we ended up doing it. It was a great year of new experiences and memories for both us, and a huge milestone in our college lives. So much awaits, and I'm excited to hear about your study abroad and adventures in Europe because I didn't know you were going to so many countries (ermm stalker caugh red handed). 
      I'm very excited that we're going to be in the same building and rooming with our friends!! I have this idea that you could come over and have breakfast some days like a lil breakfast date. I've been moving towards a whole food diet so my breakfasts look like chia seed pudding with lots of fruit and high protein pancakes with eggs.. if that interests you :p.
